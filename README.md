# Assignment 1

* Name: Vedant Mehta
* Status: Complete
* Compilation: make 
* Execution: ./piku
* Issues: It takes too long(despite being in a completely different timezone) to connect to the pi servers(unix servers are mostly instant), so a lot of the times the connection times out and thus transferring files is very tedious
